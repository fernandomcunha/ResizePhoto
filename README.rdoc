== README

Here is how to build it:

  - Open rails console and just call the business builder `PhotosBuilder.new(Photo).create_photos` so it create 10 objects and resize the images.

  - To run tests just call `bundle exec rspec`

  - I choose to use Ruby on Rails cause I can make use of many gems that would help me do the challenge.

  - Here is and example URL of the 10 images resized https://guarded-reef-13864.herokuapp.com/photos.json
